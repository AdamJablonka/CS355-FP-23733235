# IP2Weather

This project uses NodeJS to create a synchronous callback of information from one API to another.
The two API's are [Abstract API](https://www.abstractapi.com/ip-geolocation-api) and the [Free Weather API from Open-Meteo](open-meteo.com/en).

`NOTE: You will need to prove your own API key for the Abstract API (https://www.abstractapi.com/ip-geolocation-api). You can place the API key in the "credentials.json" file located in the "auth"`
